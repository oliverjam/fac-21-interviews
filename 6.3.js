// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one array from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from the first array, if they are present in the second array.

// If a value is present in the second array, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other.

function difference(array, exclude) {

}

// test(difference([1, 8, 2], []), [1,8,2]);
